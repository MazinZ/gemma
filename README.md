# Gemma
A starting point for beautiful CSS.

## Tightly focused, highly composable CSS
Built for performance, maintenance, and (re)usability, Gemma is a collection of foundational styles and classes for creating beautifully simple, highly effective CSS.

It is currently in initial development and is _not_ ready for use yet. Stay tuned for updates and proper documentation.

## Philosophy
Gemma’s philosophical approach to CSS favours:

- mobile-first, lightweight styles
- responsive design as a default
- forming both basic and more nuanced components from independent, highly recombinable pieces (think Lego!)
- designing systems that are easy for developers and designers to learn and use
- delivering the smallest amount of CSS possible to devices, browsers, and users

## Inspiration and motivation
Gemma is evolutionary, not revolutionary. Its philosophical and stylistic leanings have been heavily influenced by the following projects:

- [BassCSS](http://basscss.com)
- [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io)
- [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss)
- [ITCSS](https://twitter.com/itcss_io)

and the following people:

- [@jxnblk](http://jxnblk.com)
- [@mrmrs](http://mrmrs.io)
- [@stubbornella](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/)
- [@necolas](http://nicolasgallagher.com/)
- [@csswizardry](http://csswizardry.com/)

(and likely more whom I’ve forgotten to mention).
